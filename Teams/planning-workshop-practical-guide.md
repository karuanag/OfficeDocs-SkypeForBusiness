Tools and workshops: Plan, deliver, and adopt Microsoft Teams
=============================================================

Download these tools to walk you through planning, delivering, and adopting Teams in your organization.


- [Microsoft Teams Customer Success Kit](http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/E/9/AE984CD4-CF4B-41E7-9ABD-6735E3F01897/MicrosoftTeamsCustomerSuccessKit.zip) 
    
    This kit contains a wide range of presentations, email templates, tips & tricks, and posters that you can use to roll out and drive adoption of Teams in your organization.

    This document walks you through the five implementation phases for successfully enabling Teams. It includes a technical planning questionnaire that captures information about your organization's current Office 365 environment. This information lets the workshop leader customize the workshop presentation. The questionnaire also captures your decisions and next steps from the workshop.

- Office 365 Government Customers

   Your journey to Teams is much like our enterprise customers' experience. As Microsoft Teams becomes generally available to your tenants starting July 17th, we encourage you to start with our [Admin quick start guide](http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/3/9/F39B4F10-5720-4516-87E1-91E5A5678EFB/MicrosoftTeams-AdminQuickStart-EnableTeams.docx). Our [security and compliance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/security-compliance-overview) overview will help you feel confident about Teams in your environment.  To accommodate the requirements of our government cloud customers there are a few differences between the Government plans and that of customers on Enterprise plans. The following features will be unavailable, or disabled by default with the option for an admin to enable as noted:

|**Capability**|**Reason**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Cloud Recording  <br/> |Recording is dependent on Microsoft Stream, which will be coming to Government plans in the future.  <br/> |
|Apps <br/ | Apps (Bots, Tabs, Connectors) will not be available initially, but we are working on making these available once all their components can meet the FedRAMP Moderate compliance bar.  <br/>|
|Email a Channel <br/> | Current architecture not supported in the government plans. <br/> |
|Unified Presence <br/> |We are finishing work for our enterprise customers first for this important feature. This will arrive to government customers in the future. <br/> |
|Email Notifications <br/> |Current architecture not supported in the government plans. Work is ongoing to bring this feature to government customers in the future. <br/>|
|Giphy  <br/> |Disabled by default, but can be enabled by an admin. Please note that Giphy does send gif search terms outside of the compliance boundary. <br/> |
